Found below issue while running automation:

  - While running automation, after asking the question "I want order pizza?" either using quick reply or by send text. Chatbot does not give pizza type selections even after waiting more than a minute. So, automation tests are failing, this issue looks like a blocker.

  - While selecting pizza crust, both Thin Crust and Thik Crust image link texts are named as Thick Crust for both veg and non veg pizza's
